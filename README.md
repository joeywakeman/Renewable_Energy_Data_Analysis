# Exploratory Data Analysis of Renewable Energy Since 2000
In this project, I clean, explore, and visualize a dataset of global renewable energy metrics since the year 2000. 


## Goals
- gain an understanding of renewable energy metrics across countries and continents in the modern-day
- discover how financial aid for renewable energy development has affected renewable energy metrics since 2000


## Major Takeaways
- there is a negative correlation between the productivity/wealth of a nation and the clean energy share of their energy consumed
- financial aid for renewables strongly correlates with access to electricity, GDP per capita, and renewable energy production capacity
- African nations dominantly lead the world in clean energy share
